# nodeunit-browser-tap
[Nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) browser-side [TAP](http://testanything.org/) reporter for use with [Testling CI](http://ci.testling.com/).

Like Nodeunit's baked-in TAP reporter, but meant to run in the browser following Testling's convetion of writing test results to `console.log`.
